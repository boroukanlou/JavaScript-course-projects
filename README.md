## Welcome to My Javascript Projects Repository!

In this repository, I've organized five different projects into separate folders, each of which is valuable and engaging. Ranging from simple games to interactive and practical applications, these projects, developed based on the courses I've taken, have enabled me to step into the fascinating world of web programming and JavaScript language learning. Now, let's take a brief look at each of them:

### 1. Coin-Game:
An engaging game where you're tasked with collecting scattered coins. Use arrow keys to move the player character and increase your score. As you progress, your character grows larger, and the game background changes dynamically.

### 2. Timer:
A beautiful and interactive timer allowing you to set time intervals and perform actions like play and pause. This timer, with a circular progress display, keeps track of time for you.

### 3. Fight-Movie:
A simple program enabling you to fetch movie data from the OMDB API and compare them. You can view awards, box office earnings, Metascore, IMDb ratings, and compare movies.

### 4. Maze:
An engaging game challenging you to navigate a ball through maze obstacles to reach the goal. Use arrow keys or WASD to move the ball and achieve objectives.

### 5. Secret-Message:
A simple and entertaining application allowing you to create encrypted messages and share them with friends. Each message generates a unique link for sharing.

With these descriptions, you can delve into each folder and explore more about each project. I hope these projects prove useful and entertaining for you!
